<h2>Software Engineering</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">
Salesforce</a></h3>

My current employer for the past 6.5 years.

I started working at Salesforce before it was cool :)

Sleeperbot</a></h3>

A side project I've been involved with for the last 2 years. It is now a <a href="https://sleeperbot.com/">fully functional startup</a> and I am serving an unofficial advisory role.

<h2>Game Development</h2>

I like to do game jams and have collaborated on several projects. Here
are a few:

<h3>Nin</h3>

One of my good friends has been working on this game as a passion project
for several years. We worked on an early prototype of the game together as
a class project at Cal Poly. Since then I've given some technical advice on
the game and prototyped VR integration with the Oculus. 

<h3>Blitz</h3>

Blitz Fantasy Football was a real-time head-to-head competitive draft game for iOS and Android. I worked on the Android client and the Python/RethinkDB back-end. It has since been superseded by Sleeperbot.

<h3><a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/celavi/colorflow-beta">
Colorflow</a></h3>

This is a browser game implemented in ActionScript3. 
This game was meant to be a small-scope project to test small team dynamics and see if we could produce a finished product. I built the team, wrote portions of the gameplay code, managed source control, and set things up in Kongregate to "ship" the game. Ultimately it went over schedule and some things didn't make it into the game, but it was a good learning experience. 

<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Artificial-Intelligence-Undergraduate-Computer/dp/0857292986">Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a></h3>

I translated the German edition of this textbook for Professor Wolfgang Ertel in contract with Springer Publishing. It is now available on Amazon.
